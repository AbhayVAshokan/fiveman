# Fiveman

> This project is a fork of [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) because I don't like how it looks.

Manage Procfile-based applications

## Installation

    $ gem install fiveman

Ruby users should take care *not* to install fiveman in their project's `Gemfile`. See this [wiki article](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman/wiki/Don't-Bundle-Foreman) for more details.
